# Introduction
The candidate is the main focus of the election campaign,
where marketing is carried out by introducing his/herself, and
his/her electoral program to the electorate.

Imagine that he/she could reach the largest possible number of
residents and convey to them his/her ideas and proposals for the
development of the country! This will definitely help in
increasing the number of votes for him/her.

In this project, we aim to locate the busiest stations in New York City
and targeting it for the compaign.

# Problem Statement 
Given a sample of MTA turnstile data, we are challenged to determine  the busiest station districts in New York City.

# Data Description

The data to be tested in this project is a sample **of Turnstile
data set**. And since the majority of election campaigns happen
at the end of the year, the sample to be selected will be between
September 2018 to December 2018.
